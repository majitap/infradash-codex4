/**
 * Mock data for InfraDash.
 *
 * Every value is fake and generated deterministically (fixed reference date
 * plus seeded PRNGs) so that the static export renders identically on the
 * server and in the browser. The dashboard never calls a real API and never
 * uses tokens: all pages read from this module only.
 *
 * The data set is split by topic under lib/mock/ and re-exported here.
